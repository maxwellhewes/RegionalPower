# Regional Energy System Data Repository

This folder contains relevant datasets for modeling regional energy systems. The data is organized by region and includes both raw and processed data.

## Data Sources

All data is sourced from publicly available repositories, COMSOL Simulations, and government sources. The datasets are intended to provide the basic quantitative data necessary for calculating the need and potential for both fossil and renewable energy systems.

## Data Types

- **Raw Data:** Unprocessed data as downloaded from original sources.
- **Processed Data:** Cleaned, formatted, and aggregated data for modeling use.


## Usage

Use the data to support energy system modeling and scenario analysis.
