# Local Energy Grid Simulation Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and simulation of a local energy grid, prioritizing production (not distribution) within one of five bioregions. The goal is to enable students to analyze and optimize energy systems by integrating renewable and fossil fuel components.

## Key Features

- **Load Profile Generation:** Create realistic energy demand profiles based on regional data and consumption patterns.
- **Component Selection:** Choose and model system components (e.g., wind turbines, solar panels, gas generators, storage systems).
- **System Simulation:** Use open-source tools like TESPy (for thermodynamic modeling) and MechPy (for mechanical analysis) to simulate and optimize energy cycles and engines.
- **Efficiency \& Energy Balance:** Calculate system efficiency and perform energy balances to ensure reliable operation.


## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection:** Gather and preprocess regional load and weather data.
2. **Modeling:** Build and simulate energy systems using TESPy and MechPy.
3. **Optimization:** Optimize component parameters for maximum efficiency and reliability.
4. **Reporting:** Generate reports and visualizations summarizing system performance.

## Tools \& Libraries

- **TESPy:** Thermal Engineering Systems in Python for thermodynamic modeling.
- **MechPy:** Mechanical Engineering in Python for mechanical analysis and component design.
- **Open Data Repositories:** For load profiles, weather data, and technology parameters.
